Reading tracker app.


Users can make accounts and add books that exist in the database to their lists.

They can say if they're currently reading them and say what their progress is (number of pages read, number of volumes read, etc...)

They can give score to the books (masterpiece, good, average, bad, horrible) and say when they started reading.

Users can also say they finished a book, case in which the progress will be auto-completted with the amount of pages/volumes/etc... that the book has. User now has the option to add the date when they finished the book.

They can also create a Plan to read list, as well as a Dropped list, for books that they started but didn't like and don't want to finish.


The admin can add new authors and their books.
